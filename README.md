# Aircraft---Polymorphism
This is a simple program that demonstrates polymorphism.
The main aircraft class has several properties that are common to all aircraft. 
Then, there are three subclasses for specialized types of aircraft.

I also have a C++ vector of Aircraft pointers. This list will be populated by reading
commands from an input file. 

I have a printCharacteristics() method for printing the aircrafts. This method is overridden in each subclass.
